### Assessment declaration checklist

Please carefully read the statements below and check each box if you agree with the declaration. If you do not check all boxes, your assignment will not be marked. If you make a false declaration on any of these points, you may be investigated for academic misconduct. Students found to have breached academic integrity may receive official warnings and/or serious academic penalties. Please read more about academic integrity [here](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/academic-integrity). If you are unsure about any of these points or feel your assessment might breach academic integrity, please contact your course coordinator for support. It is important that you DO NOT submit any assessment until you can complete the declaration truthfully. 

**By checking the boxes below, I declare the following:**

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec1" name="dec1" value="Agree"> I have not impersonated, or allowed myself to be impersonated by, any person for the purposes of this assessment 

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec2" name="dec2" value="Agree"> This assessment is my original work and no part of it has been copied from any other source except where due acknowledgement is made.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec3" name="dec3" value="Agree"> No part of this assessment has been written for me by any other person except where such collaboration has been authorised by the lecturer/teacher concerned.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec4" name="dec4" value="Agree"> Where this work is being submitted for individual assessment, I declare that it is my original work and that no part has been contributed by, produced by or in conjunction with another student.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec5" name="dec5" value="Agree"> I give permission for my assessment response to be reproduced, communicated compared and archived for the purposes of detecting plagiarism.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec6" name="dec6" value="Agree"> I give permission for a copy of my assessment to be retained by the university for review and comparison, including review by external examiners.

**I understand that:**

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec7" name="dec7" value="Agree"> Plagiarism is the presentation of the work, idea or creation of another person as though it is your own. It is a form of cheating and is a very serious academic offence that may lead to exclusion from the University. Plagiarised material can be drawn from, and presented in, written, graphic and visual form, including electronic data and oral presentations. Plagiarism occurs when the origin of the material used is not appropriately cited.

- <input type="checkbox" id="dec8" name="dec8" value="Agree"> Plagiarism includes the act of assisting or allowing another person to plagiarise or to copy my work.

## Deconstruct

### Original

The original data visualisation selected for the assignment was as follows:

<br>
<center>
<img src="C:/Users/zuhaf/Pictures/Screenshots/Military_Expenditure.png" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Visualization">
</center>
<center>*Source:STOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL PEACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE(SIPRI)*</center>
<br>


### Objective and Audience

The objective and audience of the original data visualisation chosen can be summarised as follows: 

**Objective**

This visualization's goal is to present a concise, hierarchical overview of the top 15 countries in terms of military spending in 2022. 

**Audience**

Policymakers, scholars, analysts, and anybody else with an interest in learning about the relative military spending of the world's leading nations seem to be the target audience.

### Critique

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* Choice of Visualization: Although the treemap-style visualization does a good job of illustrating the data's hierarchical structure, it might not be the most logical or user-friendly option when it comes to presenting ranked data. The top military spenders could be shown in descending order using a bar chart or a horizontal bar chart, which is more recognizable and easier for viewers to quickly identify and compare the spending levels across nations.

* Color Scheme: It is challenging to discern between varying levels of military spending because every nation uses same shade of green. To make it easier for the viewer to compare and contrast the various spending levels visually, a more effective color scheme would use different hues or variations in color intensity.

* Wrong/misleading data: There is a discrepancy between the numerical values stored in the original database and the data displayed in the visualization. The numbers shown in the visualization and the actual data entries kept in the database are not the same.

## Reconstruct

### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

# Reading the data from an Excel file
file_path <- "Military_Expenditure_2022.xlsx"

# Reading the Excel file into a data frame
expenditure_data <- read_excel(file_path)
cleaned_data <- na.omit(expenditure_data)
cleaned_data$Expenditure <- round(cleaned_data$Expenditure, 2)
# Reordering the data by descending military expenditure
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data[order(-cleaned_data$Expenditure), ]
# Subset the data to include only the top 15 countries
top_15_countries <- cleaned_data[1:15, ]

r1 <-ggplot(top_15_countries, aes(y = reorder(Country, Expenditure), x = Expenditure, fill = Expenditure)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Expenditure), hjust = -0.2, size = 2.5) +
  labs(title = "Top 15 Military Spenders, 2022",
       y = "Country",
       x = "Military Expenditure (USD)",
       fill = "Military Expenditure (USD)") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightgreen", high = "darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.2)))
  

```


### Reconstruction

The following plot fixes the main issues in the original.

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
r1
```
